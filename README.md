# Futuba_RS405CB
Arduino library to control futuba RS405CB with MAX485

![circuit](https://github.com/lastVIZSLA/Futuba_RS405CB/blob/main/circuit.png)

Note: The code uses Serial1 for communicating with the MAX485 in Arduino Mega, with pins 19 and 18. Please adjust the communication pins according to the microcontroller you are using. Alternatively, you can change the #define serialPort Serial1 in the CPP file to the serial port you choose to use.
